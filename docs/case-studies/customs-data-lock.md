## The challenge

Customs Data Lock (CDL) is a family business in Indiana. Eric Brownell runs it with his sons Cole, Parker, and Teghan. The product protects American importers: anyone's shipping records are public, and competitors can trace your suppliers and copy your product. CDL files confidentiality requests with CBP so those records get pulled from public view.

In July 2026 Eric brought me in. His words in the kickoff email: evaluate where the business stands, then "help mentor the team while moving projects forward." The team had built real automation on their own — Teghan had an enrichment framework running. But it was held together with Excel exports and Google Sheets, cold email went out with a 0.20% reply rate, the website was locked inside MarketPath (which blocked blog posts and case studies and sent contact forms from a MarketPath address), and nobody on the team had worked with a real software development lifecycle.

Eric wanted two things at once: a scalable business, and a genuine entrepreneurial education for his sons. The deal was explicit — the engagement had to leave the team more capable, not more dependent.

## What I did

**Embedded as the accelerator, not the manager.** I joined their weekly L10, sat in their Slack, and worked alongside the three of them. They owned the work. I owned architecture, code review, and the security-critical parts.

**Phase 1 — rebuilt the outbound engine (July–September).**

- Rewrote the enrichment pipeline with Teghan: Import Yeti discovery, Prospeo and Google Maps enrichment, deduplication, async jobs, credit caps. Roughly 10,000 companies with shipping data, suppliers, and contacts, flowing into a real database instead of spreadsheets.
- Taught Teghan Claude Code and the software development lifecycle as we went: worktrees, pull requests, code review, deploys. When a deploy wiped the Supabase database, we debugged it together on a call and recovered all ~10,000 companies.
- Built the campaign infrastructure: cold email sequences on 7–8 domains pushed to Instantly from the database, a cold-call cockpit with opener styles and outcome-based follow-ups, and per-company personalization pulled from the enrichment data.
- Found the wedge: Import Yeti's API exposes a confidentiality-status field the UI doesn't show. Companies whose 2-year opt-out had lapsed were pre-educated prospects who already felt the pain. We built whole campaigns around that signal — three campaigns split by filing status, one email sequence each.
- Worked the strategy side: narrowed the ICP to importers doing $25–50M with >80% concentration in one product (granite, specialty weaving, metal alloys), the consultant-first cold call script, the meeting-only pricing model, and the trade-organization pilot (AAFA, ~1,100 member brands).

**Phase 2 — the website they own (September–November).** A $20,000 fixed-fee project, 100-hour cap, to replace MarketPath with a Next.js site CDL fully controls: Supabase auth and database, Stripe billing, Resend email, PostHog analytics, server-rendered pages for SEO/AEO/GEO, a markdown blog that deploys on merge, and an engineering workflow (protected main, PR review, preview deploys, Claude skills + AGENTS.md) the team keeps forever. Cole designs, Teghan builds with Claude Code, I review every PR and build the security-critical pieces myself — auth, billing webhooks, per-customer data isolation.

**Then I got out of the way.** A support retainer ($3,500, through October 18) covers async unblocking and PR review while they finish. I was out for my wedding and honeymoon in October; they kept building anyway and queued PRs for review. That was the test, and they passed it.

## Outcomes

- **Revenue per work hour up an estimated 2.75x** (and revenue up ~175%) over the engagement window — same team, same hours. ⚠️ *These are my estimates, not audited numbers. See the reconciliation note below. Get Eric's sign-off before publishing.*
- **First enterprise contracts.** A customer that had already paid $399/year for the service re-upped at scale, and Canimex, a new enterprise client, onboarded in September on a custom quote — annualized, that one account is worth more than the entire book was in July.
- **Pricing power.** CDL went from a public $399 flat rate to quote-based tiers ($600–$1,000 standard, $1,000+ multi-entity, $2,000+ enterprise), validated by Eric's own rule after we workshopped it: never put your price online.
- **The pipeline runs without me.** Teghan ships backend features with Claude Code, Cole iterated the entire site design through five preview rounds with the family leaving structured feedback, and the deploy pipeline (GitHub merge → migration → Fly deploy) runs itself.
- **The new site went from first draft to launch-ready in under a month** — September 9 first draft, October 5 DNS step pending. Teghan had "95% of the back end done and the payment system set up" sixteen days in.
- **Sales fundamentals landed.** First-ever cold email reply in early August (a 0.20% reply rate baseline), then the segmented granite/marble campaign pulled 7 responses and a real opportunity from 222 emails — targeting lapsed filers, exactly the wedge the pipeline was built to find.

## Where they are now

Support retainer runs through October 18. We review what shipped at the November 3 L10 and scope the next engagement from there. The team's goal is 250 subscriptions by January 2027, now sold through meetings instead of a checkout page. The website goes live as soon as DNS moves off GoDaddy.

## Numbers reconciliation (internal — do not publish this section)

The homepage card says **2.75x revenue per work hour** and **+175% revenue growth**, and describes them as estimates. Here is what the corpus actually shows:

| Claim | Corpus evidence | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue roughly $2K/yr before | 8 subscriptions × ~$399 as of Aug 3 ≈ $3.2K annualized; Q3 company rock was "exceed $1,200" revenue (Sep 1) | Close; no document states "$2K" |
| Revenue $5–6K/yr after | Canimex enterprise onboarding (≈$450/mo ≈ $5.4K/yr informational figure, Sep 15); Atlas $399 (Sep 1); quote tiers $600–$2,000+ | Directionally supported; no document totals it |
| 2.75x / +175% | Arithmetic on the two numbers above (5.5/2 = 2.75; (5.5−2)/2 = +175%) | Internally consistent, externally unevidenced |

The direction is real and document-backed (flat-rate $399 subscribers → enterprise contracts at 2–5x the price, during the engagement window). The precise multiplier is not stated anywhere in the corpus. Keep the word "estimated" on the homepage card, and get Eric to confirm or correct the two endpoints before this study publishes.

## Candidate pull quotes (verbatim, attributed, dated)

1. "The goal is to leave the team more capable after every project than before it began." — Eric Brownell, kickoff email, July 13, 2026
2. "I like the direction on both the outreach and enrichment pipeline." — Eric Brownell, email, August 19, 2026
3. "I have what i belive to be 95% of the back end done and the payment system set up conncted to our services email" — Teghan Brownell, Slack #website-redesign, September 16, 2026 *(sic; trim to "95% of the back end done and the payment system set up" if the typos distract)*

No invented quotes. For a headline customer quote, ask Eric directly.

### Coverage gaps (flagged, not guessed)

- Meetings reviewed in depth: kickoff era via email; Caden sales discussion (Aug 3); L10 07/31, 08/21, 09/01, 09/15; Cool Fellas 08/05; ImportYeti Scraping Fixes (Sep 18); Deployment Debugging (Sep 10). Not individually reviewed: L10 08/25, Website/Funnel/Pricing Strategy (Aug 26), Enrichment Debugging (Aug 27), Enrichment Working Session (Aug 31), Sales Outreach Strategy Feedback (Aug 18), Teghan Deliverability/Enrichment (notes only, no transcript). None of these are load-bearing for the claims above, but pull-quote candidates may be hiding in them.
- No document states the exact $2K → $5–6K revenue endpoints; see reconciliation.
- Homepage card already carries the ponytail note: numbers need Customs Data Lock's sign-off before being claimed as measured.

## Publishing checklist (Collin only)

1. Confirm or correct the revenue endpoints ($2K → $5–6K) from your own books.
2. Ask Eric for sign-off on the numbers and for one original quote.
3. Pick pull quotes; fix or trim the Teghan typo quote.
4. Decide the canonical client name on the page (Customs Data Lock vs CDL).
5. Only then: site route + homepage card swap. Do not edit the homepage card in this task.
